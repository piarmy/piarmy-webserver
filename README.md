#### This is currently in progress. This notice will be removed when ready for deployment and documentation is updated.

### PiArmy Project

This is a collection of repositories and tutorials on running **Docker** and **Docker Swarm** on a cluster of **Raspberry Pis**. From initial setup to clustered swarm deployments, this series will tackle some of the pitfalls and highlight some of the opportunities when combining clustered IoT ARM boards with Docker containers.

### Tutorials

The tutorials for this project will live here: http://www.piarmy.io/ During the development phase however, **this site will be in a Schr√∂dinger-stlye state**: it will simultaneously exist in both up and down states until visited, at which time, the wave function will collapse and reveal it's actual current state. Spoiler: it's often down more than up. Once this whole project is launched however, the tutorial site should be available around the clock.
